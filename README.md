# Color-Gravity-Points

## What this is
A little Rust program I built to learn the language. It creates a thousand points, which are attracted to each other and bounce off any walls they hit, and changes their colors based on velocity. It uses ggez and HSLUV to do this. 

## How to use
This depends on Cargo. For best performance, use cargo run --release.
